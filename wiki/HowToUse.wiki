== Introduction ==
Welcome to the How To Use of the jquery-preloader plugin. Using the plugin is pretty easy (and hopefully this page will be very short).

== Requirements ==
The plugin requires only one thing: latest jQuery, that is it. Pretty easy :)

== Usage ==
The script should be loaded after the latest jQuery is loaded, like:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="./jquery.loader.js"></script>
}}}

All function will run after the page is completely loaded! And now you are asking me: so what is the preload about?! The preload actually load the content. If you check [http://www.guilhermemori.com.br my portfolio] you will note that all the content is loaded using the preloader here presented.

So, as you can see below, you just have to call the function as stated.

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
$(function (){
    $.preLoadGUI();
});	
</script>
}}}

You will have to pass an Object with minimum content the load with an Array o elements to the function to load, here is how is an exemple:

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
$(function (){
    $.preLoadGUI({load: [
        ['bg.png', 'img'],
        ['jquery.progressbar.js', 'js'],
        ['port.css', 'css'],
        ['content.html', 'html', 'body']
    ]});
});	
</script>
}}}

The array you pass to the function is composed from other arrays. This second level arrays will be formed like this: ['address_to_load.ext', 'img|js|run|css|html', 'dom_element']

Lets see:
 * *address_to_load.ext*: just put the address to load (can be an url etc);
 * *img|js|run|css*: actually, run & js are the same thing! CSS will be added to the _HEAD DOM_ and _html_ will be added to the *dom_element*
 * *dom_element*: is the refence (just required when loading _html_) to where you want the html to be loaded. For example: '#el-id', '.el-class', 'el'

Other options can be passed in this object:
 * *bgColor*: the background color of the overlay (*Default:* #000000);
 * *bgOpacity*: the opacity of the overlay (*Default:* 0.85);
 * *message*: the message shown when loading. Has the following arguments: %f = the file being loaded, %p = percentage loaded, %c = files loaded, %t = total files (*Default:* (Portuguese) Aguarde! Carregando o site: %f (%p% | %c de %t));
 * *ending_message*: the message shown when loading is complete (*Default:* (Portuguese) Uma vez carregado o site não irá mais ser carregado.);
 * *fadeOutSpeed*: the speed the overlay will fade out once it finishes loading (*Default:* fast);

Please help testing this plugin so I can improve it!
